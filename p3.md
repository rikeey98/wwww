# AI Agent-based Specification Matching System for SoC RTL Verification

## Abstract

SoC RTL verification workflows face significant efficiency challenges due to manual processes for matching design specifications with verification test cases. This paper presents an AI agent-based integrated solution that automatically matches RTL design specifications with verification test specifications and provides an automated notification system utilizing existing stakeholder information based on matching results. The proposed system includes a specification matching agent that intelligently correlates design intent with verification objectives, and an integrated workflow that automatically sends notifications to relevant personnel. Experiments using actual SoC project data achieved accuracy rates of 98.5% for perfectly matchable data (70,000 cases), 87.3% for partially matchable data (50,000 cases), and 62.1% for highly difficult matching data (30,000 cases), with an overall average time reduction of 84% and establishment of rapid problem resolution through immediate stakeholder notifications.

## 1. Introduction

Modern SoC RTL verification involves complex coordination between design teams who create functional specifications and verification teams who develop corresponding test cases. The process of establishing connections between design specifications and verification test cases is currently performed mostly manually, resulting in significant time consumption and potential for errors.

Particularly in large-scale SoC projects, verifiers configure different verification environments for testing even for the same item, making the process of finding and matching original design specifications when failures occur extremely complex and time-consuming. Engineers typically spend 2-8 hours finding appropriate specifications, and complex cases can take several days.

Additional delays occur in the process of finding appropriate stakeholders and communicating problems, which significantly reduces the efficiency of the overall verification process.

This paper proposes an integrated AI agent-based system that automates the specification matching process and immediately sends notifications to relevant stakeholders based on matching results.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Overall Framework

The proposed system operates within an integrated data environment containing RTL design specifications, verification test specifications, stakeholder information, and historical matching records. The specification matching agent performs core matching functions, and the automated notification system delivers results to relevant stakeholders.

### 2.2 Specification Matching Agent

The specification matching agent analyzes RTL design specifications and verification test specifications to establish semantic correlations and functional mappings. The agent performs the following core functions:

**Semantic Analysis**: Utilizes natural language processing techniques to understand document intent and purpose, identifying functional blocks and interface definitions.

**Environment Adaptation**: Learns characteristics of customized environments per verifier to find connection points with standard specifications.

**Confidence Assessment**: Provides confidence scores for each matching result to enable users to evaluate result quality.

### 2.3 Automated Notification System

When matching results are generated, the system automatically extracts stakeholder information recorded in RTL specifications and verification test data to send notifications to relevant personnel.

**Stakeholder Identification**: Connects author/stakeholder information from RTL design specifications with verification test case stakeholders through matching results to determine notification targets.

**Multi-channel Notifications**: Immediately delivers matching results and related information through email, internal messaging, and web portals.

**Context-aware Notifications**: Adjusts notification content and priority based on matching confidence and problem severity.

### 2.4 Adaptive Matching Strategies

The system applies different matching strategies based on verification case complexity:

- **Perfect Matching**: Direct keyword and structural matching
- **Partial Matching**: Semantic similarity analysis and context inference
- **Highly Difficult Matching**: Pattern learning based on historical records and expert knowledge utilization

## 3. Implementation Approach

### 3.1 Data Integration and Management

Data is systematically classified based on verification task complexity and matching difficulty, with stakeholder information connected to each dataset structured for management. This enables efficient connection between matching results and stakeholder notifications.

### 3.2 Agent Implementation

The specification matching agent utilizes large language model capabilities with domain-specific prompting strategies. Differentiated processing logic based on data classification is implemented to achieve optimal performance at each complexity level.

### 3.3 Integrated Workflow Automation

A fully automated workflow was implemented that automatically extracts stakeholder information and generates notifications upon matching completion. This ensures seamless progression from matching through stakeholder notification.

## 4. Experiments and Results

### 4.1 Experimental Setup

Experiments were conducted using actual SoC project data. Testing was performed on 4 selected items from a total of 30 items, focusing on a specific version stage of one SoC project. This version contained over 150,000 verification tasks across 4 items.

### 4.2 Data Classification and Characteristics Analysis

The 150,000 verification tasks were classified based on matching complexity as follows:

- **Group A (70,000 cases, 46.7%)**: Perfectly matchable data - standard verification environment, clear specification connections
- **Group B (50,000 cases, 33.3%)**: Partially matchable data - partially customized environment, medium complexity
- **Group C (30,000 cases, 20.0%)**: Highly difficult matching data - highly customized environment, unclear specification connections

### 4.3 Specification Matching and Notification Performance
