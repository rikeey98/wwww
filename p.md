# Automated Failure Analysis System for SoC RTL Verification using Structured Knowledge Base

## Abstract

System-on-Chip (SoC) RTL verification has become increasingly complex, generating massive amounts of test failure data that require extensive manual analysis. Current verification workflows rely on manual communication between design and verification engineers, leading to analysis delays of days to weeks. This paper presents an automated failure analysis system that integrates structured knowledge bases with intelligent classification engines to streamline the debugging process. The proposed system automatically categorizes failure patterns, matches them with predefined solutions, and notifies relevant team members via web and email interfaces. Our preliminary implementation using Oracle database shows significant potential for reducing analysis time from 108 hours to 4 hours while improving classification consistency from 75% to 90%. The system addresses critical challenges in JSON parsing inconsistencies and version matching between specifications and test cases, providing a foundation for future LLM-based automation.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Modern System-on-Chip (SoC) designs have reached unprecedented levels of complexity, with billions of transistors integrated into single chips. This complexity necessitates comprehensive verification processes to ensure functional correctness before expensive fabrication. RTL (Register Transfer Level) simulation remains the primary verification method, executing thousands of test cases that validate design specifications against implementation.

However, the verification process generates substantial failure data when test cases do not meet expected outcomes. Each failure requires detailed analysis of log dumps, specification documents, and test case parameters to determine root causes and appropriate solutions. Currently, this analysis relies heavily on manual processes involving experienced verification and design engineers.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

The existing manual failure analysis workflow presents several critical limitations:

- **Time-intensive analysis**: Engineers spend 2-7 days analyzing complex failure cases, examining thousands of lines of log data to identify root causes
- **Inconsistent classification**: Different engineers may categorize identical failures differently, leading to solution inconsistencies and knowledge fragmentation
- **Communication overhead**: Multiple rounds of meetings and email exchanges between design and verification teams delay resolution
- **Expert dependency**: Analysis quality heavily depends on individual expertise, creating bottlenecks when experienced engineers are unavailable
- **Knowledge loss**: Solutions and debugging insights remain undocumented or poorly organized, requiring repeated analysis of similar issues

### 1.3 Research Contribution

This paper proposes an automated failure analysis system that addresses these challenges through structured knowledge management and intelligent classification. Our key contributions include:

- A systematic approach to structuring failure data, specifications, and test cases in a unified database
- An automated error classification engine that categorizes failures and matches them with predefined solutions
- An intelligent notification system that alerts appropriate team members based on failure types
- Practical solutions for real-world implementation challenges including JSON parsing and version matching

## 2. Related Work

Recent advances in automated debugging and log analysis have shown promising results in software engineering domains. LogLLM [1] demonstrates the effectiveness of large language models for log-based anomaly detection in system logs, achieving superior performance through structured data preprocessing compared to raw log analysis. The study shows that structured approaches improve F1-scores from 0.895 to 0.959, highlighting the importance of data organization.

MarsCode Agent [2] presents an LLM-based automated bug fixing system that combines code knowledge bases with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. The system uses ChromaDB for vector-based similarity search and implements four key memory operations: search, filter, create, and update. This approach demonstrates how structured knowledge bases can enhance LLM performance in debugging scenarios.

SWE-bench [3] provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating automated program repair systems on real-world GitHub issues. The benchmark reveals that structured approaches to problem decomposition and solution matching significantly outperform naive LLM applications, supporting our hypothesis that systematic knowledge organization is crucial for effective automation.

However, existing solutions primarily target software debugging rather than hardware verification workflows. SoC RTL verification presents unique challenges including timing-sensitive failures, protocol violations, and complex multi-domain interactions that require specialized approaches.

### 3.2 Core Components

**Structured Database Layer**: The system employs Oracle database to maintain structured relationships between specifications, test cases, failure logs, and solutions. Data is organized in normalized tables that facilitate efficient querying and pattern matching.

**Error Classification Engine**: This component automatically analyzes failure logs to identify error patterns and assign appropriate error codes. The engine uses pattern recognition algorithms to match current failures with historical data.

**Solution Matching Module**: Based on error classification results, this module retrieves relevant solutions from the knowledge base and ranks them by relevance and success probability.

**Intelligent Notification System**: The system automatically determines which team members should be notified based on error types, project assignments, and current workload, sending customized alerts via web interface and email.

### 3.3 Data Structure Design

The system implements a comprehensive data model that captures all relevant information for automated analysis:

```json
{
  "failure_record": {
    "spec_version": "v1.2.3",
    "test_case_id": "TC_MEM_001", 
    "failure_info": {
      "error_code": "E010_AXI_TIMEOUT",
      "timestamp": "2024-03-15T14:30:22Z",
      "severity": "HIGH",
      "component": "Memory_Controller",
      "log_excerpt": "AXI ARREADY timeout after 4000ns",
      "solution_id": "SOL_010_AXI_CONFIG"
    },
    "team_assignment": {
      "primary": "design_team_lead",
      "secondary": ["verification_engineer", "system_architect"]
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. Implementation Experience and Challenges

### 4.1 Current Implementation Status

We have developed a prototype system using Oracle database for structured data storage and a web interface for error code-solution mapping. The system successfully handles basic failure case notifications and provides automated alerts to designated team members.

Key implemented features include:
- Oracle database schema supporting 500+ error codes and corresponding solutions
- Web interface allowing engineers to view failure analysis results and solution recommendations  
- Email notification system that automatically contacts relevant team members based on error categories
- Basic JSON parsing for test case and specification data ingestion

### 4.2 Technical Challenges

**JSON Parsing Inconsistencies**: A significant challenge emerges from inconsistent JSON formatting in user-submitted data. Engineers frequently submit malformed JSON files with missing quotes, incorrect comma placement, or bracket mismatches. Our analysis of 200 submitted files shows that 35% require manual correction before processing.

**Version Matching Complexity**: Matching specification versions with corresponding test cases proves more complex than anticipated. SPEC files use various naming conventions (spec_v1.2.3.json, spec-1.2.3-final.json, spec_20240315_v1.2.json) while test cases reference versions inconsistently (version: "1.2", spec_version: "v1.2.3", ver: "1.2.3"), resulting in 28% matching failures in our pilot deployment.

### 4.3 Solution Approaches

To address JSON parsing issues, we implemented a robust parser with automatic error correction capabilities:

```python
def robust_json_parser(raw_json):
    try:
        return json.loads(raw_json)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        # Apply common fixes
        fixed = raw_json.replace("'", '"')  # Quote standardization
        fixed = re.sub(r',(\s*[}\]])', r'\1', fixed)  # Remove trailing commas
        fixed = re.sub(r'(\w+):', r'"\1":', fixed)  # Add missing quotes to keys
        return json.loads(fixed)
```

For version matching, we developed a normalization algorithm that extracts semantic version numbers and implements fuzzy matching:

```python
def normalize_version(version_string):
    patterns = [
        r'v?(\d+\.\d+\.?\d*)',           # v1.2.3, 1.2, 1.2.3
        r'ver[_-]?(\d+\.\d+\.?\d*)',    # ver_1.2.3, ver-1.2
        r'(\d+\.\d+\.?\d*)[-_]?.*'      # 1.2.3-final, 1.2_beta
    ]
    for pattern in patterns:
        match = re.search(pattern, version_string)
        if match:
            return standardize_version(match.group(1))
    return None
```

## 5. Preliminary Results and Analysis

### 5.1 Performance Metrics

Table 1 summarizes the performance comparison between manual processes and our automated system based on 6 months of pilot deployment data.

**Table 1: Performance Metrics Comparison**

| Metric | Manual Process | Current System | Target Goal |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Average Analysis Time | 108 hours | 24 hours | 4 hours |
| Classification Accuracy | 75% | 85% | 95% |
| Response Time to Teams | 24-72 hours | 4-8 hours | < 1 hour |
| Expert Dependency | High | Medium | Low |
| Knowledge Retention | 45% | 78% | 90% |

The current implementation demonstrates significant improvements in analysis time and response speed. Classification accuracy improved from 75% to 85% through systematic error categorization, though this falls short of our 95% target due to complex edge cases requiring human expertise.

### 5.2 Error Distribution Analysis

Analysis of 1,247 failure cases over six months reveals the distribution of error types encountered in our verification environment.

**Table 2: Error Type Distribution and Detection Rates**

| Error Code | Category | Frequency | Auto-Detection Rate | Avg. Resolution Time |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| E010_AXI_TIMEOUT | Bus Interface | 312 (25%) | 85% | 6 hours |
| E020_MEMORY_ERROR | Memory System | 249 (20%) | 78% | 8 hours |
| E030_TIMING_VIOLATION | Timing | 374 (30%) | 92% | 4 hours |
| E040_PROTOCOL_ERROR | Protocol | 187 (15%) | 80% | 12 hours |
| E050_POWER_DOMAIN | Power Management | 75 (6%) | 70% | 16 hours |
| Others | Mixed/Unknown | 50 (4%) | 45% | 24+ hours |

Timing violations show the highest auto-detection rate (92%) due to clear log signatures, while power domain errors remain challenging due to subtle symptoms and complex multi-domain interactions.

### 5.3 User Feedback and Adoption

Feedback from 15 engineers using the pilot system indicates strong acceptance for automated classification and notification features. Engineers report 60% reduction in communication overhead and improved consistency in failure handling. However, they emphasize the need for better explanation of automated decisions and more granular solution recommendations.

## 6. Future Work and Research Directions

### 6.1 LLM Integration Roadmap

Our next phase involves integrating Large Language Model (LLM) agents to enhance automated analysis capabilities. We plan to implement specialized agents for different aspects of failure analysis:

- **Analyzer Agent**: Deep failure root cause analysis using contextual understanding
- **Solution Agent**: Dynamic solution generation based on current context and historical patterns  
- **Learning Agent**: Continuous improvement through pattern recognition and solution effectiveness tracking

### 6.2 Multi-Agent Collaboration

Future work will explore multi-agent systems where specialized agents collaborate to handle complex failure scenarios requiring cross-domain expertise. This approach could address limitations in current rule-based systems by enabling dynamic problem decomposition and solution synthesis.

### 6.3 Predictive Failure Analysis

We aim to extend the system beyond reactive analysis toward predictive capabilities, identifying potential failure patterns before they manifest in test execution. This requires deeper integration with design tools and specification analysis.

## 7. Conclusion

This paper presents an automated failure analysis system for SoC RTL verification that addresses critical inefficiencies in current manual workflows. Our structured approach to knowledge management, combined with intelligent classification and notification systems, demonstrates significant potential for reducing analysis time and improving consistency.

The preliminary implementation shows promising results with 77% reduction in analysis time and 13% improvement in classification accuracy. While technical challenges remain in areas such as JSON parsing and version matching, our systematic solutions provide a foundation for broader automation.

The research contributes a practical framework for automating verification workflows while preserving the expertise and oversight that complex hardware debugging requires. Future integration with LLM-based agents promises to further enhance system capabilities and achieve full automation of routine failure analysis tasks.

Our work provides a stepping stone toward intelligent verification environments where human expertise focuses on complex design decisions rather than routine debugging tasks, ultimately accelerating time-to-market for complex SoC designs.
