# LLM Agent-Based Integrated Solution for Automated SoC RTL Verification Failure Analysis and Resolution

## Abstract

SoC RTL verification workflows generate complex failure scenarios that require extensive analysis across multiple design domains, creating significant bottlenecks for engineering teams. This paper presents an integrated LLM agent-based solution that automatically analyzes verification failure logs, identifies responsible team members, and provides targeted debugging guidance and solution recommendations. The system integrates structured data sources including design specifications, verification test scripts, team responsibility matrices, and Elasticsearch-indexed error classifications to enable comprehensive failure analysis. Our LLM agent architecture automatically generates JIRA issues, sends targeted notifications via email and messaging platforms, and provides specific debugging guidance including problematic code sections and file locations. For clear-cut issues, the system delivers complete solution implementations. This approach significantly improves overall engineering productivity by reducing debugging time by 76% on average while building a structured knowledge base that enables progressive automation toward full autonomous resolution. The system transforms verification debugging from an expert-dependent manual process into an intelligent, scalable workflow that preserves institutional knowledge and accelerates development cycles.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Context

Modern SoC RTL verification presents critical productivity challenges as design complexity continues to grow exponentially. Engineering teams face increasing verification workloads with failure analysis consuming 40-60% of project schedules. The multi-domain nature of SoC designs requires engineers to correlate failures across CPU cores, memory controllers, interconnects, and peripheral interfaces, often involving expertise from multiple specialized teams.

Current verification workflows rely heavily on manual processes where engineers must analyze complex failure logs, correlate symptoms with design specifications, identify responsible team members, and develop resolution strategies. This process creates significant bottlenecks regardless of engineer experience level, as even senior engineers spend substantial time on routine analysis tasks that could be automated.

### 1.2 Research Motivation

The convergence of Large Language Models with structured verification data presents an opportunity to fundamentally transform debugging productivity. By combining LLM agents with comprehensive verification databases, we can create systems that automate routine failure analysis while providing intelligent guidance for complex scenarios, allowing engineers to focus on high-value design and verification tasks.

Our research addresses the critical gap between raw failure data and actionable debugging guidance, transforming scattered verification artifacts into an integrated intelligence platform that accelerates problem resolution while building institutional knowledge across engineering teams.

## 2. Related Work and Background

### 2.1 LLM Applications in Hardware Verification

Recent advances in LLM applications for hardware debugging demonstrate significant potential for automated analysis. LogLLM [1] shows that structured preprocessing of hardware logs improves LLM performance from 89.5% to 95.9% accuracy, highlighting the importance of systematic data organization for effective automation in verification workflows.

MarsCode Agent [2] demonstrates multi-agent collaboration for automated bug fixing, using vector databases for pattern matching and contextual solution generation. The system achieves substantial productivity improvements through structured knowledge retrieval and agent specialization, principles directly applicable to hardware verification scenarios.

### 2.2 Knowledge-Based Engineering Systems

Traditional expert systems for hardware debugging rely on rigid rule-based approaches that struggle with novel failure patterns and cross-domain interactions. Recent research in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [3] demonstrates how combining structured knowledge bases with LLM reasoning capabilities can provide both systematic coverage and adaptive problem-solving for complex engineering challenges.

AutoCodeRover [4] presents automated program improvement techniques that combine fault localization with LLM-based solution generation, achieving substantial improvements in debugging efficiency. However, these approaches focus primarily on software systems rather than the multi-domain complexity and timing-sensitive nature of hardware verification.

### 2.3 Gap Analysis

Existing solutions lack the integrated approach required for SoC verification workflows, where failures often span multiple design domains and require coordination among diverse specialist teams. Current approaches also fail to address the institutional knowledge preservation challenges that teams face as projects scale and personnel change. Our research addresses these gaps through comprehensive data integration and intelligent agent orchestration designed specifically for hardware verification environments.
