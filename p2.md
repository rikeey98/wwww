LLM Agent-Based Integrated Solution for Automated SoC RTL Verification Failure Analysis and Resolution
Abstract
SoC RTL verification workflows generate complex failure scenarios that require extensive domain expertise to analyze and resolve, creating significant bottlenecks for junior engineers and development teams. This paper presents an integrated LLM agent-based solution that automatically analyzes verification failure logs, identifies responsible team members, and provides targeted debugging guidance and solution recommendations. The system integrates structured data sources including design specifications, verification test scripts, team responsibility matrices, and Elasticsearch-indexed error classifications to enable comprehensive failure analysis. Our LLM agent architecture automatically generates JIRA issues, sends targeted notifications via email and messaging platforms, and provides specific debugging tips including problematic code sections and file locations. For clear-cut issues, the system delivers complete solution implementations. This approach significantly reduces debugging time for junior developers while building a structured knowledge base that enables progressive automation toward full autonomous resolution. The system transforms verification debugging from an expert-dependent manual process into an intelligent, scalable workflow that preserves institutional knowledge and accelerates development cycles.

1. Introduction
1.1 Problem Context
Modern SoC RTL verification presents a fundamental scalability challenge: as design complexity grows exponentially, the expertise required for effective failure analysis becomes increasingly specialized and scarce. Junior engineers often struggle for days analyzing failures that experienced engineers could resolve in hours, creating development bottlenecks and knowledge transfer difficulties.
Current verification workflows rely heavily on tribal knowledge and manual processes. When simulation failures occur, engineers must manually correlate failure logs with design specifications, identify responsible team members, and develop resolution strategies. This process is particularly challenging for junior engineers who lack the contextual knowledge to efficiently navigate complex failure scenarios.
1.2 Research Motivation
The convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured verification data presents an unprecedented opportunity to democratize debugging expertise. By combining LLM agents with comprehensive verification databases, we can create systems that not only automate routine failure analysis but also serve as intelligent tutoring systems for developing engineers.
Our research addresses the critical gap between raw failure data and actionable debugging guidance, transforming scattered verification artifacts into an integrated intelligence platform that accelerates problem resolution while building institutional knowledge.
1.3 Key Contributions
This paper presents an LLM agent-based integrated solution with the following contributions:

2. Related Work and Background
2.1 LLM Applications in Hardware Verification
Recent advances in LLM applications for hardware debugging demonstrate significant potential for automated analysis. LogLLM [1] shows that structured preprocessing of hardware logs improves LLM performance from 89.5% to 95.9% accuracy, highlighting the importance of systematic data organization for effective automation.
MarsCode Agent [2] demonstrates multi-agent collaboration for automated bug fixing, using vector databases for pattern matching and contextual solution generation. The system achieves significant improvements through structured knowledge retrieval and agent specialization, principles directly applicable to hardware verification scenarios.
2.2 Knowledge-Based Debugging Systems
Traditional expert systems for hardware debugging rely on rigid rule-based approaches that struggle with novel failure patterns. Recent research in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [3] shows how combining structured knowledge bases with LLM reasoning capabilities can provide both systematic coverage and adaptive problem-solving capabilities.
AutoCodeRover [4] presents automated program improvement techniques that combine fault localization with LLM-based solution generation, achieving substantial improvements in debugging efficiency. However, these approaches focus primarily on software systems rather than the multi-domain complexity of hardware verification.
2.3 Gap Analysis
Existing solutions lack the integrated approach required for SoC verification workflows, where failures often span multiple design domains and require coordination among diverse specialist teams. Our research addresses this gap through comprehensive data integration and intelligent agent orchestration.
